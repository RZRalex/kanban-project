# Solo Project Proposal


# Proposed Project

I am going to make a Kanban board website fitted for multiple unique users to create, edit, and accomplish tasks together. A kanban board is an organizational tool useful for projects between one or multiple people to manage what needs to be done. There is usually columns to represent work in various stages of the process like "To Do", "Doing", and "Complete". Individual tasks or jobs are written on cards and are moved left to right to show progess and to coordinate teams doing the work. 

## Fulfilling Requirements
- This project will have users [log-in] and create a board. 
- The board owner can [create] the different stages of process for their project and create task cards that need to be done
- Users can expand a card to view [read] more details about the task
- Users can be added to a card as the task "owner". There could be multiple users assigned to a card [Many-to-many]
- Users also have a profile page which can display details about them and which tasks they are assigned to [django-engine]
- User may [edit] profile or task data
- User may [delete] profile or tasks
- People who are not logged in can see the kanban board but they cannot edit [protected]
- Application will have features like drag and drop and nice styling [static] content (CSS, images, JS)
- Tasks will have [validated] inputs to thoroughly explain the work at hand

## Bonus Stretch
- May contain [file-uploads] for profile pictures
- Cards may have checkboxes for jobs in a list that can only be moved after all checks are done.
- Drag and drop will [update] status of task card as you move it.
